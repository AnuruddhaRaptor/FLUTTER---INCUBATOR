// var datatype 

void main(){

	var x = "Shashi";
	print(x);

	var y = 20.5;
	print(y);
}

/* 

	1) var stores all generic types of things in it.
	2) we should not use this coz this has a major drawback.
	3) The data we give to var initailly becomes its DEFAULT datatype for the rest of the code.
	4) Although it may be good for dynamic datatype allocation, but it is not praticed often ,
	   it has its special use cases that will come along our journey.
