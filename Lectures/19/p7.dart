	# Standard Input

	1) The .readLineSync() function in the Dart programming language allows you to take
	   input from the user via the console.

	2) To get input from the console, you will need to import the dart:io library as shown 
	   above.

	3) Stdin Class : This stdin class allows the user to synchronously and asynchronously 
	   read data from standard input.

	4) One of the methods used to take the input from the user is readLineSync().
