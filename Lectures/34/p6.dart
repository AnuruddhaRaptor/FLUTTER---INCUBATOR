	# Dart Set 

	1) A set is a collection of unique elements.

	2) Unlike a list, a set doesn't maintain the order of elements.

	3) Typically, a set is faster than a list, especially when working with large elements.

// Code :


Set empData = {18 , "Ashish" , 2.0 , 18};

void main() {

        print(empData);
        print(empData.runtimeType);
}
